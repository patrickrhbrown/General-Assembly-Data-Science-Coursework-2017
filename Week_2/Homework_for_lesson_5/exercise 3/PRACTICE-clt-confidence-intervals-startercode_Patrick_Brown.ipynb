    "Confidence limits for the mean (Snedecor and Cochran, 1989) are an interval estimate for the mean. Interval estimates are often desirable because the estimate of the mean varies from sample to sample. Instead of a single estimate for the mean, a confidence interval generates a lower and upper limit for the mean. The interval estimate gives an indication of how much uncertainty there is in our estimate of the true mean. The narrower the interval, the more precise is our estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Confidence limits are expressed in terms of a confidence coefficient. Although the choice of confidence coefficient is somewhat arbitrary, in practice 90 %, 95 %, and 99 % intervals are often used, with 95 % being the most commonly used.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a technical note, a 95 % confidence interval does not mean that there is a 95 % probability that the interval contains the true mean. The interval computed from a given sample either contains the true mean or it does not. Instead, the level of confidence is associated with the method of calculating the interval. The confidence coefficient is simply the proportion of samples of a given size that may be expected to contain the true mean. That is, for a 95 % confidence interval, if many samples are collected and the confidence interval computed, in the long run about 95 % of these intervals would contain the true mean."

It is also the fact that we expect the mean of the sampling distributio of the sample mean to be the same as the mean of the population that enables us to factor such confidence levels.  So although the sample is not normally distributed, the sampling distribution of the sample means are and from that we can infer facts about the parameter."
