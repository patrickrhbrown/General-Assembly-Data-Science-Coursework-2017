Those that fall outside that range will be subject to further scrutiny, and we will determine how many of these are due to experimental/transcription or clerical error in gathering the data. However, the outliers should not be discarded if they are simply higher or lower values than bounds since they might connote interesting features about the data, or lead to interesting new null hypotheses and further analysis.  \n",

If there is any particular structural weakness in the data, it is likely to be here given the high level of subjectivity that underpins it.
